Read `~/code/agent-configs/AGENTS.md` before anything (skip if missing).

Goals:
- A software development factory where i can do all my work.
- Replace Github

Principles: self-hostability, simple code, configurability to serve any user (eventually) and really good abstractions which make those possible. i want you to help me on the abstraction in particular.
